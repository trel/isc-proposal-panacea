# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done

The deliverable "Installable package on CRAN and presentation" of Section \@ref(sec:Technical) defines achievement of the minimal goal.
<!-- 
What does success look like?

## Measuring success

The actual success during the development phase is measured by the number of contributions and the number of laboratories that we can engage with. The success of the developed package is measured by use-cases through download statistics, and for development purposes, by tracking how many packages will integrate this package.

How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

Future work revolves around integration of the package with the services offered by FAIReLABS. It will enable consulting and implementing better resources for data management in analytical laboratories as well as help teaching efforts focussing on data management and reproducible science. In addition, we will potentially consider writing a paper concerning package for the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/). And, continuously advertise usage of the package by active engaging with target user-base at conferences and social media. 


## Key risks

One of the key risks in the process of developing the package is the selection of the appropriate solution (as listed in Section \@ref(sec:Detail)). Hence the early identification of this bottleneck and the formulation of two contingency plans will help alleviate these risks to some extend. Problems and delays in terms of coordinating community feedback (especially desired use-cases) and contributions (mainly solutions as listed above) could stem from a lack of consensus on the specific topic. Hence we aim to address this at the earliest stages of the project (Months 1--2). In terms of tools and technology, we foresee the largest problem in access to enough analytical data. Hence we ensured that we have already a minimal set of data available for testing purposes. All the before mentioned risk could increase the time required to develop the product. However, by defining a set of minimal deliverables, we can at least define the current state of current data management practices in analytical laboratory facilities and develop a road-map on how to improve these infrastructures.
