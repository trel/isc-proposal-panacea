# The Problem

Analytical laboratories are a huge source of data. Unfortunately, laboratory data streams are often fragmented and not well curated. We reason that this is caused by the range of analytical instruments populating the lab---each with their own closed-sourced vendor-supplied data models and software suites for subsequent data processing, analysing, and diagnostics (see "Unconnected Lab" Fig \@ref(fig:intlab)). These various data models stored on local devices, if accessible at all, are not easily integrated in a centralised data management infrastructure. This so-called "vendor lock-in" further prevents transparency of the workflow from raw to analysed data. Although low-level access to raw data and insights in workflows is not necessary for all scientist, it can be important for special purpose research questions, possibly sparking new innovations and discoveries. The fragmented, and partly obscured, nature of data streams from analytical laboratories therefore conflicts with data management principles, such as formalised in the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data guiding principles [@Wilkinson2016], and have a negative impact on the reproducibility of science. Existing solutions for reading data, such as *readr* [@readr] and *vroom* [@vroom], can be cumbersome for this particular task, as the unstructured and large (>1,000 lines) (meta)data formats prevents straightforward parsing. This has resulted in a series of custom solutions, e.g., xrftools [@xrftools], isoreader [@isoreader], and point [@point], for various machine-specific data models (this is a non-exhaustive list). 

<!-- Improving access to this analytical data is not only beneficial to the individual user but can also improve data management infrastructures for labs, which is pertinent to open science,  -->

Hence, a more universal solution to this problem of analytical data collection and harmonisation is therefore a rewarding endeavour for future innovations and discoveries. In addition, FAIR data is conducive to an inclusive, connected worldwide academic community---providing opportunities for developing countries that do not have the same resources for data generation as wealthy countries.
